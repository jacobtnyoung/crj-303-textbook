    "text": "1.2 The Four Levels of Measurement\n\n1.2.1 Nominal (Name Only)\nThese are just labels — categories with no inherent order.\nExamples\n- Type of crime (Assault, Theft, Fraud)\n- Neighborhood (Downtown, North End, Eastside)\n- Season (Fall, Summer)\nCan we say that ‘Fraud’ is more than ‘Assault’? No — they’re just different categories.\nBut what if we say it was “more violent”?\n\n\n1.2.2 Ordinal (Order Matters, But Spacing Doesn’t)\nThese have a meaningful order, but the distance between ranks isn’t consistent.\nExamples\n- Trust in the police (1 = Poor, 2 = Somewhat, 3= Not Sure, 4= Sort of, 5 = Excellent)\n- Crime severity (Low, Moderate, High)\n- Level of fear of crime (Low, Medium, High)\nIs a ‘High’ severity crime exactly three times worse than a ‘Low’ one? Probably not.\nWhat about trust in the police?\n\n\n1.2.3 Interval/Ratio (Equal Spacing)\nHere the units are consistent, so the values are meaningful.\nExamples - Number of arrests\n- Incident response time (minutes)\n- Property damage ($)\n- Victim age\nIf one officer took 10 minutes and another took 20, can we say one took twice as long? Yes — because zero means none.\nCan we say there are half as many crimes in a neighborhood compared to another?\nNote: if the variable has a true zero point, then it is called a ratio level of measurement.",
