# Lecture 3: Visualizing Data with Bar Charts

## Scenario

When examining data, we often want to describe how people, cases, or outcomes are distributed across categories.
In the last lecture we saw how to do that using frequencies and proportions. 
We can also usual visualizations to illustrate the information in a table of frequencies and proportions.  

Bar charts are one of the simplest and most powerful ways to show those differences visually. 
Bar charts are best for **nominal** or **ordinal** data, as they make comparisons between categories easy to see.  

## Distribution of Case Types and Disposition

Suppose we had some data on 20 recent cases filed in court. The raw data reports the case type and disposition.

| Case ID | Case Type | Case Disposition |
|:-------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| 1 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 2 | Property | Dismissed |
| 3 | Drug | Plea Agreement |
| 4 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 5 | Violent | Convicted at Trial |
| 6 | Drug | Plea Agreement |
| 7 | Property | Pending |
| 8 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 9 | Drug | Dismissed |
| 10 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 11 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 12 | Drug | Plea Agreement |
| 13 | Property | Pending |
| 14 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 15 | Violent | Convicted at Trial |
| 16 | Drug | Plea Agreement |
| 17 | Property | Plea Agreement |
| 18 | Property | Dismissed |
| 19 | Drug | Plea Agreement |
| 20 | Property | Plea Agreement |

Suppose we had the following research question: *What are the the most common type of case in the county court system?* How could we answer this question?

### Frequency and Proportion Table

Let's start by making a table of frequencies and proportions

<!-- make table smaller -->
\small

| Case Type  | Frequency (**f**) | Proportion (**p**) |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| Property   |                12 |       12/20 = 0.6  |
| Drug       |                 6 |       6/20 = 0.3   |
| Violent    |                 2 |      2/20 = 0.1    |
| **Total**  |            **20** |  **20/20 = 1.00**  |

\normalsize

In looking at our table, what can we say about our research question?

### Create a Bar Chart

In a *bar chart*, each bar represents a type of case. 
The height of the bar shows how many cases fall into each category. 
The x-axis shows the categories. 
The y-axis shows how many cases are in each category.

So, to create a bar chart, we draw the axes and then a bar for each category:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

library( ggplot2 )

# Create the data
cases <- data.frame(
  case_id = 1:20,
  case_type = c(
    "Property", "Property", "Drug", "Property", "Violent",
    "Drug", "Property", "Property", "Drug", "Property",
    "Property", "Drug", "Property", "Property", "Violent",
    "Drug", "Property", "Property", "Drug", "Property"
  )
)

# Create a print-friendly bar chart with discrete y-axis values
ggplot(cases, aes(x = case_type)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Case Types",
    x = "Case Type",
    y = "Number of Cases"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1)   # force whole-number counts
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 14),
    title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )

```

#### What does the chart tell us?

### Let's do it again

Now, what if our research question was: *What are the the most common case dispsotions in the county court system?* How could we answer this question?
