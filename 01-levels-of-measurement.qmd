# Lecture 1: Understanding Levels of Measurement

## Discussion

-   When we say we *measure* something in criminology, what do we actually mean?
-   What kinds of data do we collect about crime?

Each of those pieces of information has a different kind of structure. Some are just categories, others have an order, and some are numerical with real measurements. To analyze them correctly, we need to know what **level of measurement** they belong to.

## The Four Levels of Measurement

### **Nominal (Name Only)**

These are just labels — categories with no inherent order.

**Examples**\
- Type of crime (Assault, Theft, Fraud)\
- Neighborhood (Downtown, North End, Eastside)\
- Season (Fall, Summer)

Can we say that ‘Fraud’ is *more* than ‘Assault’? No — they’re just different categories.

*But* what if we say it was "more violent"?

### **Ordinal (Order Matters, But Spacing Doesn’t)**

These have a meaningful order, but the distance between ranks isn’t consistent.

**Examples**\
- Trust in the police (1 = Poor, 2 = Somewhat, 3= Not Sure, 4= Sort of, 5 = Excellent)\
- Crime severity (Low, Moderate, High)\
- Level of fear of crime (Low, Medium, High)

Is a ‘High’ severity crime exactly three times worse than a ‘Low’ one? Probably not.

What about trust in the police?

### **Interval/Ratio (Equal Spacing)**

Here the units are consistent, so the values are meaningful.

**Examples** - Number of arrests\
- Incident response time (minutes)\
- Property damage (\$)\
- Victim age

If one officer took 10 minutes and another took 20, can we say one took *twice as long*? Yes — because zero means none.

Can we say there are *half as many* crimes in a neighborhood compared to another?

*Note*: if the variable has a true zero point, then it is called a **ratio** level of measurement.

## Practice

What are the levels of measurement?

| Example Variable                                 | Level of Measurement |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Type of weapon used                              |          ?           |
| Sentence length (years)                          |          ?           |
| Inmate security level (minimum, medium, maximum) |          ?           |
| Year of conviction                               |          ?           |
| Number of prior convictions                      |          ?           |

## So what?

Why does it matter to know the level of measurement?

-   It determines which statistical tools we can use\
-   It shapes how we interpret averages or differences\
-   It helps us understand what our numbers *actually represent*
